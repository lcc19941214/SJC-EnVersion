						Nucleotide-binding domain (NBD)- and leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing proteins (NLRs) are critical for the cytosolic immunosurveillance system of mammals. Dysregulation of NLR function is associated with several human diseases. NLRs are pattern recognition receptors that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or host-derived danger components, resulting in NLR activation and oligomerization. The oligomerized NLRs then recruit procaspase-1 (pro-Casp1) either directly or through the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (caspase activation and recruitment domain) (ASC), forming inflammasomes that catalyze Casp-1 activation. Once activated, Casp-1 proteolytically processes pro-interleukin 1β (pro-IL-1β) and pro-IL-18 to initiate host innate immune responses

						NLRC4 (NOD-like receptor containing CARD 4), one member of NLRs, recognizes the cytosolic flagellin and the rod protein of type III secretion system. In the resting state, NLRC4 is autoinhibited with the mechanism being elucidated by our previous work (http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6142/172.full). Once sensing PAMPs, NLRC4 is activated and oligomerizes into multi-protein signaling complexes termed inflammasomes, activating the inflammation and other immune reactions. NLRC4 containing inflammasomes are activated by bacterial pathogens carrying flagellin or the components of type III secretion system (T3SS). Specificity for different bacterial ligands is dictated by NLR apoptosis inhibitory proteins (NAIPs). In mice, direct recognition of the bacterial flagellin and the T3SS rod protein PrgJ is mediated by NAIP5/6 and NAIP2, respectively. Ligand binding induces NAIP interaction with NLRC4 followed by oligomerization of their complex. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the activation of NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome is poorly understood.
